title: Skeumorphism is not the problem

A lot of people are very excited that [Jonathan Ive](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jony_ive) will be [working on both industrial design and UI design](http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2012/10/29Apple-Announces-Changes-to-Increase-Collaboration-Across-Hardware-Software-Services.html) at Apple. The end of skeumorphism at Apple! Finally. I think we can all agree that iCal is pretty bad design.

So, yeah, fuck skeuorphism. Flat design forever. I'm glad this conversation is over. Until we add a gradient to a button in a design. The gradient makes it feel like a button from the real world. Shit. Skeumorphism again.

This is a good thing. I am not suggesting we stop using gradients.

Designers like the idea that we're right and everyone else is wrong (just look at my blog). It's true of grids, colors, and with skeumorphism. But there isn't a right or wrong in design. Design is pretty much a gray area. Even when most designers agree on a rule we can also usually find someone breaking that rule to do something awesome.

So let's abandon the idea that someone is even a designer or not a designer. The term "designer" is really just an infinite line. At one end we have people with absolutely no design skills. At the other end we have people like [Charles and Ray Eames](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_and_Ray_Eames), [Dieter Rams](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dieter_Rams), Jony Ive, and the guy who invented [YTMND.com](http://hasselhoffdolphin.ytmnd.com/).

Everyone I've ever met has a sense of design, everyone is able to tell me what looks good to them. That's taste. Some of my favorite designers are also really good developers. I think it's because the secret to being good at design is actually the same as development: a lot of practice and good taste.

The problem with all bad design, skeumorphism included, is *taste*. It's fun to make fun of skeumorphism but when I glance at Dribbble I see a lot of it done tastefully. I also see a lot of beautiful flat design. It's because a particulary strategy or aesthetic isn't really the problem with bad design, it's a lack of taste.

Good taste is harder to learn, but it's what prevents things like iCal from happening. iCal's design isn't awful because it's skeumorphic, it's awful because it's skeumorphic in a tasteless way. A more subtle texture, a less harsh gradient, and more cues from other OSX apps could make iCal less of a laughingstock.
