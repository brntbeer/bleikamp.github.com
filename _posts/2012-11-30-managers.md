title: <del>No</del> managers
layout: post
summary: Remember when I tweeted a thing about GitHub not having any managers? It was true, but not really.
---

A few weeks ago I
[tweeted](https://twitter.com/bleikamp/status/261160546836045824) an observation
after looking at [GitHub's about](http://github.com/about/team) page:

> 130 employees at GitHub now. Still no managers.

I didn't think it was all that interesting, but it got a lot of questions. Some people thought it simply couldn't be true. Others were like, "Yeah, fuck managers!" But managers aren't bad. I didn't mean for it to be the point of the tweet.

A co-worker pointed out that it's actually not a true statistic…sort of. We like to say that everyone is a manager at GitHub, which means now we have 132 managers. It sounds like a bullshit company value to make people feel empowered, right? "You're all managers! Manage! Lead!"

But it's not.

[Ryan Tomayko](http://tomayko.com) recently talked about the subject. He mentioned that the reason we say that is because the things that managers are normally expected to be good at are things that *all* GitHub employees end up doing.

It means every employee is responsible for hiring the best people, communicating information across teams, and helping others become better at their job. No one gets to say, "well, that's not what I was hired for." It's what *everyone* was hired for in addition to their role as a developer or designer or accountant.

The other thing people brought up was that, "surely there are *leaders*." As though leadership comes from management. Of course there are leaders. But they aren't leaders of people so much as they are leaders of projects—we run the company like an open source project, where no one is told what to do. More importantly (I think) is that leadership comes from *doing things*. No one had to appoint the leaders at GitHub, it's obvious to everyone who they are.

This is not to say that every company can or should operate this way. But it does work pretty well for GitHub. And I think most companies could apply some principles from open source development to let people work more autonomously.
